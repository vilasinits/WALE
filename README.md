**WALE** (pronounced *WAL-E*, short for **W**avelet **‚Ñì‚ÇÅ**-norm **E**stimator) is a Python package for predicting and analyzing the one-point statistics of the wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm in cosmological density fields. It supports both theoretical predictions based on large-deviation statistics and direct measurements from simulations or observational data, enabling cross-scale comparisons and validation.

## Quickstart

Explore the example notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to get started with theory predictions or applications on your own data.

---

## Key Features

- Theory Predictions: Estimate the expected wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm at each scale from the one-point PDF using Large Deviation Theory.

- Stochastic Extensions: Preliminary support for stochastic modeling is included and currently under testing.

- Modular Design: Use individual components or the full pipeline depending on your use case.

Included Modules
  - Wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm computation

  - Cosmological data I/O and preprocessing

  - Covariance estimation and modeling

This toolkit supports reproducibility of results from our paper and can be extended for new simulations or observational datasets.
