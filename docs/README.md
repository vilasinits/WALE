# Overview


The `WALE` package provides a theoretical framework to model the wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm of weak lensing convergence maps. This is achieved using predictions of the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) at each wavelet scale, based on large-deviation theory (LDT). The method enables simulation-free inference of higher-order statistics in cosmological fields.

Development Status
------------------

The package is in its **initial phase** and several features are still being tested, including:

- A model for incorporating **stochasticity**
- Support for real data inputs
- Extension to additional filtering schemes

Key Features
------------

- Predicts the expected ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm at each wavelet scale from theory
- Includes a model for incorporating **stochasticity**, currently under testing
- Modular

Modules include:

- l1-norm computation
- Cosmology I/O and preprocessing
- Covariance modeling

Use this package for reproducibility of results in the paper or to apply the method to new data or simulations.
