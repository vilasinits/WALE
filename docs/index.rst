WALE (“Wavelet ℓ₁-norm Estimator”) is a Python-based toolkit for predicting and analyzing the one-point statistics of the wavelet ℓ₁-norm in cosmological density fields, as introduced in:

Sreekanth, V. T.; Codis, S.; Barthélemy, A.; Starck, J.-L. “Theoretical wavelet ℓ₁-norm from one-point probability density function prediction,” Astronomy & Astrophysics 691, A80 (2024).
DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202450061 (arXiv:2406.10033)

WALE is a successor to the earlier LDT_2cell_l1_norm code (https://github.com/vilasinits/LDT_2cell_l1_norm), extending its capabilities to different filters, and a more modular design.
