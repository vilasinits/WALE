# WALE ‚Äî Wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm Estimator

**WALE** (pronounced *WAL-E*) is a Python toolkit for predicting and analyzing the one-point statistics of the **wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm** in cosmological density fields. It combines theoretical predictions based on one-point PDF expansions with direct measurements on simulations or observational data, enabling robust multi-scale comparisons.

##  Features

- **Theoretical Predictions**  
  Derive analytical estimates of the wavelet ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm's mean and variance using one-point PDF expansions rooted in Large Deviation Theory.

- **Wavelet Decomposition**  
  Perform multi-scale analysis with wavelet bases such as top-hat and starlet to extract scale-resolved information.

- **‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm Measurements**  
  Compute the ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm of wavelet coefficients on weak lensing convergence fields efficiently and accurately.

- **Theory vs. Simulation Comparison**  
  Built-in routines to overlay theoretical predictions with simulation results, including visualization tools and diagnostic metrics.

- **Modular API**  
  Clean, extensible architecture with dedicated modules for theory, analysis, I/O, and utility functions.

- **Parallel Processing (Coming Soon)**  
  MPI-based support for handling large cosmological datasets in parallel.

- **JAX Integration (Coming Soon)**  
  Accelerated computation and auto-differentiation via JAX for high-performance workflows.
